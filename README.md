## 💭 Reflection

### ✅ What Went Well
- Successfully built a clean, responsive, fully functional UI with vanilla JavaScript.
- Implemented key business logic like pagination, filtering, sorting, and CRUD operations without backend dependency.
- Maintained good code organization and modularity.

### 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness for toolbars and forms.
- Simulating a clean form modal and side-filter layout with plain JS and CSS.
- Managing search + filter + sort + pagination interactions simultaneously.

### 🔧 Improvements for the Future
- Add persistent storage using `localStorage` or mock APIs (like JSON Server).
- Implement unit testing using Jest or similar.
- Refactor to modular JS files using ES Modules or a framework like React.
- Add animations, transitions, and keyboard accessibility for better UX.
